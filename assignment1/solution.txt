Based on the echo server client example in the textbook the network communication between the client and the server
works well when there is only one client.

Exceeding maximum file size for the server
------------------------------------------------------
In a socket connection if the size of the input byte stream is greater than 64 bytes. 

Solution
------------------------------------------------------
When the size of the byte stream which needs to be sent over exceeds the limit i.e 64bytes
then the server will close that socket and wait for a new connection to be established.

------------------------------------------------------
Client sending the same message
------------------------------------------------------

Bad Client
------------------------------------------------------
If the client is sending the same message again and again and causing difficulties for the other client to process their messages

Solution
------------------------------------------------------
We can create a flag in the server and check if the same message has been sent to the server if the same message has been sent to the 
server then just close the socket connection for that client.

------------------------------------------------------
Concurrent request handling by the server
------------------------------------------------------

Bad Client
---------------------
When the  data in the form of bytes which needs to be sent to the server is limited, that is small, then the echoing of the
information occurs in a real time way without causing any disturbances to the other clients. If there are more than one client in the 
system and the size of the data to be transfered is high then the wait time of other clients also increases and this causes 
slow process time of the total client requests.

Solution 
-----------------------
This can be eliminated by making a multiple copies of the client socket in the server which can handle multtiple requests 
at a time. The multiple copies of the client socket can be implemented using threads where we can create a new thread whenever 
a request comes from a newly created client and this thread takes care of the new echo message that arrives by creating a new socket 
that works at that same port and echoes all the commands concurrently.
